Proposal 1
😭/😂/💀 (maybe 🗿 too?) context similarities
This project is about emojis that are used differently than their “intended meaning”. In particular, 😭 is sobbing, 😂 is tears of joy or crying with laughter, 💀 is a skull, and 🗿 is a moyai statue. It was found that these emojis are used synonymously on social media (e.g., Twitter) in certain contexts despite the intended meanings being different. Since this topic pertains to meaning and will be using data from Twitter, this will be a semantics project investigated with a corpus. The population that might produce the data we’re interested in is social media users in their teenage years to mid-twenties. The data source that would be best to find examples of this phenomenon is on social media, particularly on Twitter because of the vast amount of data that can be found.
Examples of the phenomenon:
“You eating butter by itself? 💀” twitter link
“When u drink a lot of liquids and you can hear it sloshing around in ur stomach wen u run up the stairs 💀💀” twitter link
“PLEASE not the womp womp sound effect 😭😭” twitter link
“bro a 30 min drive is NOT far 😭😭” twitter link
“If you can leave me on read for hours and sleep comfortably, you don’t love me fr 😂😂😂” twitter link
“You ever been in the car with someone who drives like we got extra live 😂😂” twitter link
“what does this have to do with me??🗿🗿” twitter link
“i opened sims 4 at 2 am then sat there staring at the screen for 45 minutes before closing it 🗿🗿🗿” twitter link
Relevant, contrasting data would be the use of these emojis in different contexts. There are plenty of examples for these as well.

Proposal 2
This proposal focuses on the phonology of English loanwords in Japanese and whether they are regular and/or can be computationally described/automated. 
In Japanese, English loanwords are usually written in the form of the Katakana alphabet. 
As it turns out, English => Japanese loanwords undergo a fairly complicated process when converting to Japanese phonology. 
This process involves phonetic, phonemic, orthographical and historical considerations. 
While a computational tool to calculate these loanwords would no doubt be a massive undertaking when considering the entirety of Japanese (Optimality theory is far more suited to this), examining a small set (perhaps of inputs we know have regular outputs) could be a far more in scope project.
Some examples of English loanwords written Japanese:
             Romanization        Japanese
Beer            biiru                ビール    
Bus            basu                バス
Coffee            koohii                コーヒー
Disneyland        dizuniirando            ディズニーランド
Google            guuguru            グーグル
Kit Kat            kittokatto            キットカット
McDonalds        makudonarudo            マクドナルド
Starbucks        sutaabakkusu            スターバックス
Taxi            takushii            タクシー

Or another idea is to focus on Japanese loanwords in English. Such as
            Romanization    Japanese
Karaoke        karaoke        カラオケ
Ramen            raamen            ラーメン
    (the words above are written in the Katakana alphabet)
Sushi            sushi            すし
Typhoon        taifuu            たいふう
Tsunami        tsunami        つなみ
    (the words above are written in the Hiragana alphabet)
